Easily convert your SQL database into a REST API.
====================================================
This is a lightweight Express.js middleware library that is able to convert SQL databases into a REST API. This library also works
seamlessly with the [Form.io](https://form.io) platform where you can build Angular.js and React.js applications on top of your SQL database. Please go
to https://form.io to learn more.

**This library currently supports Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.**

How it works
--------------
This module works by assigning routes to specific queries, which you define, that are executed when the routes are triggered. For example,
lets say you have the following customer table.

**customer**
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - email

This library is able to convert this into the following REST API.

  - GET: /customer - Returns a list of all customers.
  - GET: /customer/:customerId - Returns a single customer
  - POST: /customer - Creates a new customer
  - PUT: /customer/:customerId - Updates a customer
  - DELETE: /customer/:customerId - Deletes a customer.

Please refer to the **example** folder to see how this library is used to achieve the following.

How to use
-----------------
This library is pretty simple. You include it in your Express.js application like the following.

```
var express = require('express');
var resquel = require('resquel');

// Create the Express.js application.
var app = express();

// Include the resquel library.
app.use(resquel(config));

// Listen to port 3000.
app.listen(3000);
```

The configuration passed into the resquel library is where the magic happens.

```
{
  "db": {
    "user": "-- YOUR DATABASE USERNAME --",
    "password": "-- YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD --",
    "server": "-- YOUR DATABASE SERVER --",
    "database": "-- YOUR DATABASE NAME --",
    "options": {
      "instanceName": "-- THE SERVER INSTANCE --"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "method": "get",
      "endpoint": "/customer",
      "query": "SELECT * FROM customers;"
    },
    {
      "method": "post",
      "endpoint": "/customer",
      "query": "INSERT INTO customers (firstName, lastName, email) VALUES ('{{ data.firstName }}', '{{ data.lastName }}', '{{ data.email }}');SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id=SCOPE_IDENTITY();"
    },
    {
      "method": "get",
      "endpoint": "/customer/:customerId",
      "query": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id={{ params.customerId }};"
    },
    {
      "method": "put",
      "endpoint": "/customer/:customerId",
      "query": "UPDATE customers SET firstName='{{ data.firstName }}', lastName='{{ data.lastName }}', email='{{ data.email }}' WHERE id={{ params.customerId }};SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id={{ params.customerId }};"
    },
    {
      "method": "delete",
      "endpoint": "/customer/:customerId",
      "query": "DELETE FROM customers WHERE id={{ params.customerId }};"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each route defines a new endpoint and maps a query to that enpoint. Within the query, you have access to the following.

  - **data** - The req.body of the request.
  - **params** - The req.params of the request. Like when you use /customer/:customerId
  - **query** - The req.query of the request. Used with GET parameters like this /customer?company=1234


Enjoy!
